# 🛒 Walmart Sales Analysis Project

## 📌 About the Project
This project is based on Walmart sales data.  
I cleaned and prepared the raw dataset using Python and then used SQL queries to calculate important KPIs.  
The main purpose of this project is to understand sales patterns and generate useful business insights.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- SQL  
- VS Code  

---

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset contains Walmart sales information such as store details, product data, sales values, and time-based fields.  
Since the raw data was not clean, preprocessing was required before analysis.

## 🔧 Data Cleaning (Python)
Using Python libraries, I performed the following steps:
- Removed duplicate records  
- Handled missing values  
- Corrected data types  
- Renamed columns for better understanding  
- Created a clean dataset for further analysis

## 📊 KPI Analysis (SQL)
After cleaning the data, SQL queries were used to generate KPIs such as:
- Total sales  
- Average sales  
- Store-wise sales performance  
- Product-wise sales analysis  
- Monthly and yearly sales trends
